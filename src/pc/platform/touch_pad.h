/* An on-screen controller for touch screens (phones, tablets, touch
 * laptops): a D-pad, the four face buttons, L1/L2/R1/R2, SELECT and START
 * at the sides of the window, and MENU (which opens the menu bar's first
 * menu) under L2/L1, drawn with the game's own button pictures and font off
 * the disc (touch_pad_art.c). It feeds the first controller's bits beside
 * the keyboard and the pads, as the button it shows (Cross is Cross,
 * whatever View > Japanese buttons says), and a press shorter than a frame
 * still counts once, as a key's does (controls_runtime.c).
 *
 * View > Touch controls: Automatic shows it after the screen is touched and
 * hides it again when a key or a controller button is pressed; Show and
 * Hide keep it so. Hidden, it draws nothing and takes no touch, so the
 * window is what it is without it. Main thread only; the logic here has no
 * other dependency, so tests drive it directly. */
